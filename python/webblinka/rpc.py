"""JSON-in, JSON-out dispatch for calls arriving from the page.

The worker holds a single PyProxy -- ``dispatch`` -- and invokes it with
``callPromising`` so that stack switching is enabled for the whole call. That is
what lets everything underneath (Blinka, a driver, the hid shim) block on a HID
round-trip through ``run_sync`` while staying ordinary synchronous Python.

Arguments and results cross as JSON rather than as proxies: it keeps object
lifetimes out of the picture and means a handler can only return things the UI
can actually render.
